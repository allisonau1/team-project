## Project Description

### Domain: Organization

BookShelf is a personal book-tracking and library management application that allows users to discover, review, and organize books they have read.

Using the Open Library API, users can search for books by title and view information about different books, including their title, author, publication year, and cover image. Users can select books to add to their personal bookshelf, assign ratings, and write reviews or comments to record their reading experiences.

The application provides a visual representation of the user's bookshelf, allowing them to browse their collection and sort books by different attributes such as title, author, rating, genre, and date added. Users can also manually rearrange the order of books to personalize their bookshelf.

The goal of BookShelf is to provide users with an interactive and customizable space to document and organize their reading experiences.

- Custom bookshelf ordering will be considered a post-MVP feature.
